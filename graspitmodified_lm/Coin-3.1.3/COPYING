Coin is copyright (C) 1998-2010 by Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies (KOGT).
All rights reserved.

Coin is generally available under three software licenses.  Unless special
arrangements has been made with KOGT, it is the Coin Free Edition that is
being used.

1) GNU General Public License ("GPL")

   KOGT is a staunch supporter of Free Software.  We have benefited
   greatly (and continue to do so) from using Free Software ourselves.
   To contribute back, KOGT distributes Coin freely under the GPL for
   use in Free Software. Coin under the GPL is called the Coin Free
   Edition. See the file LICENSE.GPL for the full license text of the
   GPL.

2) Coin Professional Edition License ("Coin PEL")

   The Coin PEL is a personalized developer license for using Coin for
   all non-Free Software development. The PEL gives you the right to
   develop and distribute proprietary applications with Coin3D and
   includes free technical support and upgrades.

   For information about acquiring Coin Professional Edition License,

3) Coin Evaluation License ("Coin EL")

   The Coin EL is a time-limited software license for evaluation purposes,
   with rights similar to those granted by the PEL. The purpose of the
   Coin EL is to be used in an evaluation phase when deciding whether or
   not to choose the Coin PEL solution.

If you want to use Coin for academic projects or educational purposes,
and neither the GPL nor the Coin PEL are appropriate for you, special
accomodations might be made on a case-by-case basis.  Please contact us
