200 "Fake" NVidia stereo reported to not work with Coin / SoWin/SoQt.

    There's an add-on to NVidia's drivers at

      http://www.nvidia.com/object/3dstereo_71.89

    ..which I assume uses some kind of trick to make a stereo signal
    out of a mono GL scene (intercepting and transforming the camera-
    and projection-related state changes?). This is reported to not
    work with Coin: the (attempted) stereo images comes out with
    strange rendering artifacts, which seems to stem from the camera
    settings being wrong.

    For a user's guide, see:

    And a more technical overview:

    The reporter's system:

        * NVidia Geforce6800 Graphicscard
        * Windows XP
        * latest NVidia drivers + NVidia 3D Stereo Driver
        * Coin 2.4.2

    He also reproduced the problem with an NVidia Quadro. The driver
    add-on likely also works with other (and older) NVidia cards.

    To reproduce, running SoGuiExamples' components/simpleexviewer is
    sufficient, as long as this is done to the viewer configuration
    (or the stereo will not kick in):

        viewer->setFullScreen(TRUE);
        viewer->setDecoration(FALSE);
