201 Coin 2.4.1 + SoQt 1.2.0 + Qt 3.3.4 hangs on Win98.

    We've had an external report that the above combination hangs on
    Win98 systems, even when just attempting to display a simple
    SoQtRenderArea. The same combination, but with Coin 2.2.1, does
    not hang (!). It is unclear whether or not they tried with SoQt
    from CVS.

    The reporter gets the following error message in the terminal
    window where the application is run from, and supplies to
    following information:

----8<-------------- [snip] -------8<-------------- [snip] -------------
        ---------------
        GetModuleHandleA succeed

        LoadLibrary returns baaa0000
        not a dibseciton
        fail GetSurfaceFromDC, ddVal = 887600ff

        bddraw = 1

        fail GetSurfaceFromDC, ddVal = 887600ff

        bddraw = 1

        not a dibseciton
        fail GetSurfaceFromDC, ddVal = 887600ff

        bddraw = 1
        ---------------

        The corresponding Window stays lightgrey (backgroundcolor set
        to black) and the CPU Load rises to 100%. Termination of the
        Task is not possible (Win98) and so I have to make a hard
        reset.
