184 SbOctTree::findItems() functions not multi-CRT safe on Windows.

    The SbList-use in the function signatures of these strongly
    indicates that they can cause problems when used in a run-time
    environment where the client code uses a different CRT than the
    Coin DLL.

    (By mixing allocation and deallocation of memory from different
    CRT heaps, which causes hard-to-find memory corruption bugs.)

    Probably best solved in a similar manner as has been done before
    for a few other classes: duplicate these functions, but with a
    safe signature, then deprecate the use of the original ones.

    UPDATE 20060210 mortene: I have an idea for a better
    solution. Memory resources passed into functions with unsafe
    signatures for environments with multiple C run-times could have a
    check to see whether or not the memory actually originated from
    the same run-time as the code working on it.

    Haven't investigated closely, but from a cursory look, I believe
    this should be possible with some of the more obscure Win32 API
    calls.
