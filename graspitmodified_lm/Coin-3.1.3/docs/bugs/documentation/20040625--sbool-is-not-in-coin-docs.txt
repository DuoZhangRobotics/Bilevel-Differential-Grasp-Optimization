119 Documentation bug: SbBool is not part of the Doxygen-generated
    doc.

    Even though documented in src/misc/SoDB.cpp, documentation for
    SbBool is not generated by Doxygen. This used to work.

    Perhaps the problem is that SbBool is documented as a \class,
    while it should be a \typedef?

    Fool around with Doxygen a bit and find out why it fails, then
    make the necessary changes (to the SbBool doc block in SoDB.cpp,
    probably).

    This is a low priority issue.
