139 SoText2 nodes never culled?

    Coin-user Nikolai Brezin reports on coin-discuss that his
    investigations seem to indicate that SoText2 nodes are never
    view frustum culled.

    According to pederb, this is caused by the bounding box caching
    for SoText2 to be invalidated with changes to the SoCamera node
    (as e.g. when updating the near and far planes from the viewer
    auto-clipping). So when rendering comes to the SoSeparator above
    the SoText2, no valid bbox is available, and culling will not be
    done. See also bug item #099.

    Medium priority issue: has unfortunate consequences for
    performance, especially for scenes with a lot of SoText2 nodes.
