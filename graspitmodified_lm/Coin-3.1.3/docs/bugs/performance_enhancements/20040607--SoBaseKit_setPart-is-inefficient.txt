115 SoBaseKit::setPart() is inefficient.

    When this function is called on a part which was NULL previously,
    a default node on that part is first made, before the part is set
    to the argument to setPart(). This is inefficient and should be
    unnecessary.

    Priority low on this problem, as it shouldn't cause any serious
    harm.
