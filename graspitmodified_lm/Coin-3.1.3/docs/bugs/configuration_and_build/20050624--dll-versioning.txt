198 MS Windows DLL versioning.

    For several good reasons[*], we should add the version number to
    the DLL "resources" (or however it's done).

    See following URL for information on the VERSIONINFO resource:

    [*] Helpful when working with more than 1 Coin DLL on a system,
    during debugging sessions, for instance, as a DLL version number
    is visible when simply checking its properties in the Windows
    Explorer.
