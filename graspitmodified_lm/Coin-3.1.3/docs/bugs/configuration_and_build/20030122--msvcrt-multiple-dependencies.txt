052 MSWin dependency walker gives surprising results.

    We have a report that Coin and SoQt configure with
    --with-msvcrt=multithread-dynamic-debug will still have a
    dependency on *both* msvcrtd.dll and msvcrt.dll.

    Should investigate closer whether this is to be expected or not,
    and if yes, how this can happen.
