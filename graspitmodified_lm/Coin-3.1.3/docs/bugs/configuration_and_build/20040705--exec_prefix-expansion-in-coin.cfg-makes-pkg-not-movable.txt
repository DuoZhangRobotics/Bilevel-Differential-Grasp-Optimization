120 @exec_prefix@ expansion in Coin/coin.cfg.in makes installed
    package not movable.

    Note that simply replacing with

      exec_prefix="${prefix}"

    is not the correct fix either, as an "exec_prefix" different from
    "prefix" can be set by a configure option.

    The correct solution may be to replace @exec_prefix@ with a new
    variable name (e.g. "@cfg_exec_prefix@"), then expand this to
    either "$prefix" or an absolute path, depending on how configure
    was invoked. If the latter (absolute path), warn the user at the
    end of the configure run that the installation is not movable (and
    explain why this is so)

    That's the best I can think of.

    This is a low priority issue.

    UPDATE 20051220 mortene: the same also seems to be the case for
    the So*-libraries' so*.cfg files.
