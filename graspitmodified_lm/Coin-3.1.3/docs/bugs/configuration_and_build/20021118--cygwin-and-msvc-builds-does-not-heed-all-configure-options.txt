044 Release builds on Cygwin/MSVC++ doesn't heed all configure
    options.

    Specifically, "--disable-symbols" should remove the "/Zi" option
    to cl.exe, and "--enable-optimization" should add "/O2" (or some
    such).

    20021118 mortene, problem reported by Michael Wimmer on
    coin-discuss.

    20021118 larsa - the --disable-symbols problem is fixed, and I'm
    against adding "--enable-optimization".  The users should rather
    specify the optimization options they want in CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS.

    20021121 larsa: since Autoconf automatically adds -O2, we should
    consider adding an option to remove that option, if it can be
    made to work without touching user-set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS and only
    the autoconf-set optimization-options.  Tricky stuff...
