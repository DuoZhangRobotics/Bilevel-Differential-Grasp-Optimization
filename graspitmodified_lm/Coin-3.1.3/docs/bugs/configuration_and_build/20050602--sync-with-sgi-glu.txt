193 superglu should be sync'ed against SGI GLU.

    This should be done with regular intervals, to get any bug fixes
    etc migrated into superglu. This hasn't been done for a long time
    now.

    We should also send back any important bugfixes we've made
    ourselves.

     UPDATE 20060130 mortene:

        I made a small amount of fixes, some important, but most of
        them syntactic (making their original C code also compilable
        by a C++ compiler, for instance) when I grabbed the GLU source
        code and made the "superglu" repository.

        So to sync up, one should really first do something like a
        "cvs diff -u -r <start> -r <today>" on the repository, sort
        through the diff and pass on to the responsible SGI engineer.

        Then sync with the changes made to GLU between our fork date
        and today.

        It's a non-trivial task, partly because I've been sloppy
        enough to let it drift / rot.
