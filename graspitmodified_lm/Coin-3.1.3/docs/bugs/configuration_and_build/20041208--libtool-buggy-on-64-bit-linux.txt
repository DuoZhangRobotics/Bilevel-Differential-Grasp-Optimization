177 Libtool is buggy on 64-bit Linux.

    The fairly old version of Libtool we are currently using for
    bootstrapping, version 1.5, has known bugs on 64-bit Linux systems
    with GCC.

    Should upgrade to latest if there are no known showstoppers.
    (Lars, any info on this?)

    UPDATE 20060210 mortene: i believe we've upgraded libtool at
    least once since this bug was filed, so the problem may be
    gone -- someone needs to check.
