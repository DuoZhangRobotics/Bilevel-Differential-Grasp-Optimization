123 coin-config --setup uses hardcoded LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable name
    and is incompatible with e.g. tcsh

    Not all platforms uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH for specifying the path
    to dynamically loaded libraries.
    It also uses bash-style assignment of variables.

    This bug also exists for other projects using --setup.
