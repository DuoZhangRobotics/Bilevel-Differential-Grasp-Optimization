103 Need more 'ivinfo' information

    We should be able to see which version of simage and freetype
    and similar libraries has been detected by Coin.  The simage
    information should also list supported file types / plugin APIs
    in use.  The full path to the actual libraries would also be
    nice to see.  Too often people wonder why textures don't load -
    this would give that answer right away.

    Note: Duplicate bug entry (025) in SoQt/BUGS.txt because this
    must be implemented in cooperation between both libraries.
