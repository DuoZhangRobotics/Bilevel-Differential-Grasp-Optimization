033 Some of the default geometry files for dragger geometries uses an
    SoDrawStyle::lineWidth > 1.0. This can be outside the legal range
    of the OpenGL implementation, which only guarantees that 1.0 can
    be used. (We have indeed received at least one problem report due
    to this.)

    I'm working on a solution for this, which involves setting up some
    new global fields which contains the legal ranges of glLineWidth()
    and glPointSize(). From .iv-files, one can then connect to these
    global fields.

    UPDATE 20040804 mortene: my idea mentioned above for a fix had a
    fatal flaw, so this problem is still unresolved.

    UPDATE 20051103 pederb: SoGLLineWidthElement now checks the
    supported OpenGL range, and clamps the line width to be inside
    that range. Bug seems to be fixed.

    UPDATE 20060203 mortene: I consider the fact that we will still
    get warnings upon those dragger files on such lame OpenGL drivers
    for a "buglet", at least. Our own iv-files within the library
    should behave perfectly, and so the value of the lineWidth fields
    should be dynamically adjusted to be correct _before_ detected
    during rendering and warned about.

    But, OpenGL drivers with such limitations should now have become
    exceedingly rare, so I'm pushing this into our "likely obsolete"
    category.
