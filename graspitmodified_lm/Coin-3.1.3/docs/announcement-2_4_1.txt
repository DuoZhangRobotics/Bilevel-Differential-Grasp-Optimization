Coin 2.4.1 Released
===================

Systems in Motion is proud to release v2.4.1 of the Coin 3D graphics
library.  Coin 2.4.1 is a patchlevel release.  Patchlevel releases
contain mostly bugfixes, optimizations, documentation improvements,
and configure and build setup fixes.  This release does not extend the
library API beyond the previous release.


NEWS File Excerpt:
------------------

* new features:
  - minor: SoExtSelection RECTANGLE and LASSO selections can now be
    aborted by the end-user by hitting the 'END' key
* bugfixes:
  - SbString::sprintf() trusted some undocumented behaviour of the
    C-library function vsnprintf(), which at least failed with recent
    GNU libc versions on 64-bit platforms
  - SoOffscreenRenderer now properly handles multiple renderings
    interleaved with changes to viewport size
  - removed some possibilities for false positives with the mechanism
    for detecting multiple Coin DLLs in a process image on MS Windows
    platforms
  - fixed obscure SoOffscreenRenderer problem on scene graphs where
    renderCaching was explicitly set to ON for camera sibling
    SoSeparator
  - the SoIntersectionDetectionAction could cause asserts due to
    floating point inaccuracies

See the ChangeLog file if you want the really gory details.  See
the file RELNOTES on changes that might affect Coin usage.
