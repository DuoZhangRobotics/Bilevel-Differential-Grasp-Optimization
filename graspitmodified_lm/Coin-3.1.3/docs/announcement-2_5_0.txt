Subject: Coin 2.5.0 Released


Coin 2.5.0 Released
===================

Systems in Motion is proud to release v2.5.0 of the Coin 3D graphics
library.  Coin 2.5.0 is a minor release.  It extends the functionality of
previous versions of Coin 2.* in upward compatible ways.  It also fixes
bugs and problems found in releases 2.0.0 through 2.4.6, and includes
updates to the documentation.  The API and ABI of the library have been
considerably extended for this version, but not in any way that could
conflict with older versions of Coin 2.*.
