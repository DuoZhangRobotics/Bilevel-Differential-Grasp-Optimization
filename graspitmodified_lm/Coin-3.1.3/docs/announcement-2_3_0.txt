Coin 2.3.0 Released
===================

Systems in Motion is proud to release v2.3.0 of the Coin 3D graphics
library.  Coin 2.3.0 is a minor release.  It extends the functionality of
previous versions of Coin 2.* in upward compatible ways.  It also fixes
bugs and problems found in releases 2.0.0 through 2.2.1, and includes
updates to the documentation.  The API and ABI of the library is slightly
extended, but not in any way that could conflict with older versions of
Coin 2.*.

NEWS File Excerpt:
------------------

* new features:
  - new node SoTextureCombine (for multi-texturing)
  - new texture coordinate mapping nodes SoTextureCoordinateCube,
    SoTextureCoordinateCylinder, and SoTextureCoordinateSphere
  - vertex buffer objects support
  - correct "sorted layers blend" transparency mode
  - improved thread safety
* bugfixes:
  - loading of engine networks from file with default field values
  - misc bumpmapping bugfixes
  - plugged various memory leaks
  - offscreen renderer fixes: alpha channel support, robustify
  - improved library cleanup
  - sensor fixes: delayqueue timeouts handled in Coin instead of in SoGui
  - corrected scene redraw logic not to depend on realtime field updates
  - and lots more...
* optimizations:
  - file reading should be noticable faster
  - more/improved use of vertex array rendering and vertex buffer objects
* other:
  - build setup updates, doc updates, Mac OS X packaging fixes

See the ChangeLog file if you want the really gory details.  See
