Coin 2.4.3 Released
===================

Yesterday's Coin 2.4.2 release contained a couple of ugly regressions.
They are now fixed, and here is the new 2.4.3 patchlevel release.


NEWS File Excerpt for 2.4.3:
----------------------------

* bugfixes:
  - SoText2 regression in 2.4.2; text would be too large on MS Windows
  - SoText2 regression in 2.4.2; if Coin was built multithread-safe,
    font rendering would hang the application
  - file import regression in 2.4.2; could no longer read binary
    Inventor 2.0 files

NEWS File Excerpt for 2.4.2:
----------------------------

* new features:
  - Support for compressed textures
  - Windows: build settings are easier tunable from the Visual Studio
    projects (edit include/setup.h), and also includes static library
    build options now
* optimizations:
  - major improvements to SoOffscreenRenderer performance,
    approximately 3x faster for simple scene graphs
  - OpenAL library now loaded only on demand, i.e. when sound is
    actually used
* bugfixes:
  - Postscript output for the SoOffscreenRenderer was erroneously
    disabled
  - SoFaceSet with SoShapeHints::faceType set to UNKNOWN_FACE_TYPE
    could come out wrong
  - 64-bit windows port issues believed to be resolved
  - Reinstanded missing default-2d-font characters
  - Inventor V1.0 .iv file import fixes
  - SoToVRML2Action fixes
  - Font/glyph handling fixes
  - and more...
