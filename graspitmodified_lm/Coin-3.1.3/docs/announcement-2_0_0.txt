Systems in Motion releases Coin version 2.0.0

Oslo, Norway, February 27th 2003

Coin is a high-level 3D graphics library with a C++ Application Programming
Interface. Its target audience is developers of 3D graphics applications
worldwide.

Coin 2.0.0 is now available from www.coin3d.org. The new version includes
major additions in functionality such as:

- Handling huge texture-maps, up to hundreds of megapixels, by lifting
  the conventional limits of the graphics cards.
- 3D Texture support.
- 3D Sound support.
- Support for the ISO standard VRML97 model and scene file format.
- Full quality support for the Mac OS X operating system.
- Improved build system on Microsoft Windows.
- Provides convenient abstractions for cross-platform threads-handling.
- Efficiently taking advantage of big-iron visualization systems with
  multiple output pipes (e.g. CAVE systems), by rendering data structures
  in parallel on multiple processors.

Other improvements include major performance optimizations for faster
rendering, a better framework for download and deployment on Microsoft
Windows platforms, miscellaneous feature enhancements requested by the
Coin user community, and many documentation improvements.

"Coin has been received very well by 3D software developers", says Einar
Hübert, CEO of Systems in Motion. "Coin started as a spin-off from other
software development projects, but has now become core of the company. We
will focus even more on development of Coin and increasing its market
position in the years to come. Coin is a very stable and reliable tool,
and version 2.0.0 makes it more accessible to the broad range of 3D
developers globally."

Coin 2.0 is Free Software released publicly under the GNU General Public
License ("GPL"), and is also available for any proprietary use under a
Professional Edition License (Coin PEL). The price for becoming a Coin
PEL holder is USD 2,000 per developer per year. There are no royalties
or hidden extra costs. The Coin PEL text has been modified slightly from

Examples of professional users of Coin are General Electric, Caterpillar,
Shell, Statoil, HitecO, Midland Valley, Fedem Technology and ConocoPhilips.

Examples of users of Coin under the Free Software license are CERN,
NASA, the Vienna University of Technology, and the Norwegian University
of Science and Technology 

About Coin

Coin is based on the SGI Open Inventor API. Open Inventor has long since
become the de facto standard graphics library for 3D visualization and
visual simulation software in the scientific and engineering community. It
has proved its worth over a period of more than 10 years, its maturity
contributing to its success as a major building block in thousands of
large-scale engineering applications around the world.

Coin uses scene graph data structures to render real-time graphics
suitable for mostly all kinds of scientific and engineering visualization
applications.

Coin is portable over a wide range of platforms: any UNIX / Linux /
*BSD platform, Microsoft Windows operating systems, and Mac OS X.

Coin is built on the industry-standard OpenGL immediate-mode rendering
library, and adds abstractions for higher-level primitives, provides 3D
interactivity, immensely increases programmer convenience and productivity,
and contains many complex optimization features for fast rendering that
are transparent for the application programmer.

About Systems in Motion

Systems in Motion is a global supplier of advanced 3D visualization
software. Our customers range from NASA as a part of Mars-missions, to
Shell deep down in the North Sea, - from car manufacturer Toyota in Japan,
to the US Army simulating tomorrow’s battlefields.

SIM's most recognized product besides Coin is Rational Reducer Professional
3.1. Rational Reducer reduces the number of polygons in 3D models, while
keeping the visual quality, thus reducing the rendering time and file size.

In addition to the products Coin and Rational Reducer, SIM contribute
with custom-made software and consulting services, or complete project
solutions for 3D visualization systems.
