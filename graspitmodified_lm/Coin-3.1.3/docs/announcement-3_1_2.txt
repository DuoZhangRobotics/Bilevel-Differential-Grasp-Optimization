Coin 3.1.2 "Buffalo spawn"
==========================

Kongsberg SIM is proud to release version 3.1.2 of the Coin 3D
graphics library.  Coin 3.1.2 is a bugfix release.  It keeps binary
compatibility with the previous version of Coin (3.0.0), and it is
with only minor exceptions upward source code compatible back to Coin
1.0.

Coin 3.1.2 does not add any functionality over version 3.1.0.

Documentation builds must use a version of doxygen older than 1.6. As
of the release date, the newest version of doxygen 1.6.1 has a
regression bug, which causes some errors when trying to build Coin.

We have discontinued the use of our subversion repositories. All
further development of Coin and associates is now occuring in
Mercurial (http://mercurial.selenic.com). Our public repositiories are
available from http://hg.sim.no.

It should also be mentioned that the Coin v3 series will be the last
set of releases of Coin to support the archaic Microsoft Visual C++
6.0 compiler, which has become a big pain to keep supporting at this
point, C++ languagewise.  Just a word of warning to VC++6.0 users out
there.  This is the beginning of the end of the line.
