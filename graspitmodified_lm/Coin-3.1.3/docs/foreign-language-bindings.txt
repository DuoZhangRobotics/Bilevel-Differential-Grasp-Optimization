C# / .NET
=========

  * A paper on how to use SWIG to generate a C++-binding for .NET:

    <URL:http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~songyanf/code/papers/mspaper.htm>

  * There's something called swigsharp as well. Don't know how swigsharp
    compares to swigcsharp (mentioned in the article above) though.

========================================================================
Java
====

  * Here's the tutorial starting point at Sun's Java pages for
    interfacing to alien code through the Java Native Interface:

    <URL:http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/native1.1/index.html>

  * Kahlua: <URL:http://www.igd.fhg.de/CP/kahlua/>

    A Java wrapper for the Open Inventor library. Sadly not open
    source, so we can't port it to Coin unless the author changes the
    licensing terms. larsa@sim.no has been investigating.

    Maintainer is no longer Arno Schaefer <schaefer@jobpilot.com>, but
    Volker Luckas <luckas@igd.fhg.de>.

  Update 2002-06-17: Kristian Eide and Morten Vold have more or less
  completed this task during a spring 2002 student project.

========================================================================

Python
======

  * Unfinished attempt at wrapping SGI Open Inventor with SWIG:
    <URL:http://www.cs.uit.no/~olemb/software/pyinventor/>.

  * SIP is a SWIG-like thing specially tuned for Python bindings, more
    information here: <URL:http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde/>.

  Update 2002-06-17: check Tamer Fahmy's "pivy". Mission accomplished?

========================================================================

Scheme
======

  * Ivy is a fully working port of a Scheme engine with an Inventor
    API (with SoXt) binding, see <URL:http://www.coin3d.org> for more
    information.

========================================================================

Common Lisp
===========

  * Common Lisp OpenGL-bindings (Allegro, GCL, CMUCL, ...):
    <URL:http://ww.telent.net/cliki/OpenGL%20Bindings>.

========================================================================

Ruby
====

  * Ruby can interface to Python, and johng has used this to use Coin
    from Ruby with success. That is only a quick hack, though, and not
    a "proper" binding.
