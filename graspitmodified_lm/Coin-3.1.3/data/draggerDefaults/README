These are the scene graph geometries used as default geometries for
the various draggers in Coin.

They have all been statically compiled into the library, but can be
overloaded by setting the SO_DRAGGER_DIR environment variable to a
directory with replacement geometries for the draggers you will be
using (like this directory, for instance).

Be sure to use the same filenames for the .iv-files as in this
directory, and you will also need to use the same node names as in the
geometry specifications within these files for the draggers to
recognize and extract the parts they consist of.
