/* Here's a posting I made on Usenet 2003-02-19 with queries about
   increasing the robustness of the symbol binding process on MSWin
   DLLs. I'm keeping it here for reference, just so we remember that
   there are potential problems:
  
   ------8<------[snip]------8<------[snip]------8<------[snip]----
      Newsgroups: comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
      Subject: Possible to do calling convention query?
      Gcc: nnfolder+archive:out-news
      From: Morten Eriksen <mortene@sim.no>
      Organization: The Underpant Gnomes
      --text follows this line--
      Hi,
      
      I have a delicate problem with robustness which I would like to try to
      solve. The outline of my problem is as follows:
      
        * I'm using LoadLibrary() to bind to the symbols of a DLL at
          run-time.
      
        * This DLL was generated outside of my control.
      
        * I bind to function pointer symbols of the DLL with something like
          the following snippet of code:
      
            typedef void (__stdcall * nurbsProperty_t)(void *, int, float);
            nurbsProperty_t nurbsProperty =
                 (nurbsProperty_t)GetProcAddress(<dllhnd>, "nurbsProperty");
      
            // Now the function can be used like any other, e.g. like this:
            //
            // nurbsProperty(NULL, 0, 0.0f);
      
        * Now, notice the "__stdcall" part of the function signature
          typedef. As you all probably know, this specifies the _assumed_
          calling convention of the function, i.e. how arguments are pushed
          on the stack, and if it's the caller's or the callee's
          responsibility to clean up the stack afterwards.
      
      Now here's the problem I would like to solve: if the "nurbsProperty()"
      function of the DLL was built with a different calling convention than
      __stdcall (say, __cdecl), my subsequent invocation of the method will
      lead to either a corrupted set of input arguments, a corrupted stack
      upon return, or both. Therefore, I would like to *detect* whether the
      DLL function symbols actually matches the calling convention I expect.
      
      Can this be done through the Win32 API somehow? I.e. getting to know
      what calling convention an exported function in a DLL was built with?
      
      (I guess it can be done by loading the DLL file into memory "raw", and
      parsing its structures of the DLL / PE file, but that is _really_ the
      last resort.)
      
      Regards,
      Morten

   UPDATE 20030221 mortene: from the replies, it looks like this is
   impossible to do in a "clean" way (i.e. through the Win32
   API). Only suggestion that could be implemented so far is to check
   the value of the stack pointer before and after calling a function
   from the DLL.
  
   Additional suggestion from Lars: we could let the user control
   calling convention from the client side by setting an environment
   variable. That would be really helpful for remote debugging of
   problems suspected to be caused by mismatches.

  \page libraries Coin use of 3rd party libraries.

  Coin may use a wide variety of 3rd party libraries, directly and
  indirectly, depending on how the Coin build was configured.  This
  document tries to summarize the situation.  Some of the libraries
  that are a standard part of an operating system are ignored here.

  This document expects that the reader is familiar with library build
  processes and has knowledge of various concepts such as
  "configure-time", "linktime", and "runtime" related to library
  builds and behaviour.

  First of all, Coin requires \b OpenGL. Depending on the OpenGL
  version, features in Coin are turned on and off. If a feature Coin
  is supposed to suport does not seem to produce any result, make sure
  to check that the underlying OpenGL version does support that
  feature. OpenGL is linked into Coin both at linktime and runtime.
  Features added to OpenGL later than the oldest version of OpenGL we
  support in Coin are always tried linked up at runtime, and failure
  to do so will disable features in Coin or cause alternate
  implementations of features to be used instead.

  OpenGL is accompanied with a set of auxiliary libraries we also use.
  These are libraries like \b GLext, \b GLU (for NURBS tessellation
  and texture mipmaping amongst others), \b CgGL (for shaders that use
  Cg (we recommend using GLSL instead BTW)).  Of these libraries, CgGL
  is loaded at runtime if needed, while the others are linked with
  Coin at linktime.

  Some platforms have GLU libraries that don't behave properly in
  certain respects, and some Coin users have particular needs wrt
  Coin's use of GLU. For these users, we (at Kongsberg Oil & Gas
  Technologies) have created a fork og GLU that we have named \b
  SuperGLU that we have tweaked in certain ways.  This library can be
  checked out into the Coin source code directory, which will be
  detected at configure-time and linked statically into Coin and used
  instead of the GLU libraries on the host system.

  In addition to these libraries, Coin will use \b AGL on Mac OS X, \b
  WGL on MS Windows, and \b GLX on X Windows Systems for offscreen
  rendering purposes.

  We now move on to libraries that are not related to OpenGL.

  Coin uses \b libz (aka \b zlib) and \b libbzip2 to read and/or write
  files compressed with either of those compression techniques.  Both
  libraries can ble linked with Coin at linktime or loaded at runtime,
  and this is controlled at configure-time.  They can also be disabled
  if compressed file input/output is not wanted.  The libz library is
  likely to be pulled in as a dependency from other libraries as well,
  especially graphics libraries.

  For font support, Coin uses \b Fontconfig or \b FreeType in addition
  to native platform APIs for font reading.  Freetype can be loaded at
  runtime instead of linked at linktime if desired, but FreeType is
  only used if Fontconfig is not found at configure-time anyway,
  unless the library builder overrides this behaviour.

  For JavaScript support in VRML97, Coin uses \b SpiderMonkey.
  SpiderMonkey can also be loaded at runtime instead of linked at
  linktime.

  For sound support in VRML97, Coin uses \b OpenAL. OpenAL is loaded
  at runtime or linked at linktime. BTW, some versions of the OpenAL
  library delivered with installers from Creative on MS Windows have
  been known to crash/freeze Coin-applications when loaded, so if you
  experience something like that, that's one thing to investigate.

  For threading support, Coin uses POSIX threads (\b pthread library)
  or the native Win32 API on MS Windows. You can use pthread on MS
  Windows as well instead of the native threads by setting this at
  configure-time.

  We now come to a special class of libraries that has been directly
  integrated into the Coin source code, thereby not requiring the
  libraries to be installed on the system beforehand for Coin to build
  or run.

  Coin makes use of certain utilities like smart-pointers from \b
  Boost. The boost headers can be found under \c include/ in the Coin
  source code directory. No boost types are exposed in the Coin API,
  nor will they ever be. They are completely hidden, viewed from the
  outside of Coin. All boost types used in Coin are completely inlined
  in the boost headers and therefore do not require a link library to
  pull their implementation from at runtime.

  For XML reading, Coin uses the \b expat library, which has also been
  integrated directly into Coin, so also here there are no extra
  linktime or runtime dependencies to other libraries. The expat API
  is not exposed in the Coin API, it is hidden, but Coin provides its
  own XML DOM API that is a wrapper over the expat engine.

  The last thing to mention here is hardly a library, but we mention
  it anyway. Coin uses \b flex and \b bison to generate some parsers
  (one for the STL 3D model file format, and another one for parsing
  the calculator language in the SoCalculator engine). This is code
  that has been generated by 3rd party parser generators and
  integrated into Coin. The generated code is distributed with the
  source code, so neither flex nor bison is needed to build Coin.

  And last but definitely not least, Coin uses \b simage...

  \section simage The simage library

  Coin uses a library called \b simage, which is a 1st part library
  since we have written it ourselves.  Simage is a thin wrapper
  library over a huge set of graphics and audio libraries, to provide
  Coin with a unified API for loading images (textures), audio, and
  animations, regardless of which image file format it is stored as.
  The simage library can in other words pull in another set of 3rd
  party libraries. All 3rd party libraries to simage are optional.
  Simage is loaded at runtime or (if specified) linked at linktime
  with Coin.

  Simage can use QImage from \b Qt to add support for the file formats
  Qt supports.

  Simage can use \b GDI+ (gdiplus) under MS Windows to add support for
  the file formats supported by GDI+.

  Simage can use \b QuickTime under Mac OS X to add support for the file
  formats QuickTime supports.

  Simage can use \b libungif or \b giflib for GIF file support.

  Simage can use \b libjpeg for JPEG file support.

  Simage can use \b libpng for PNG file support.  This will also require that
  \b zlib is used.

  Simage can use \b libtiff for TIFF file support.

  Simage can use \b JASPER support for JPEG 2000 file support.

  Simage can use \b mpeg2enc for MPEG2 encoding.

  Simage can use \b vfw (Video for Windows) for AVI video encoding.

  Simage can use \b libogg, \b libvorbis and \b libvorbisfile for Ogg
  Vorbis support.  This is for VRML97 sound support in Coin.

  Simage can use \b libsndfile for VRML97 sound support in Coin.

  Simage can use \b libguile for a Guile (Scheme) binding for the
  Simage library API.

   Using the process handle to get at OpenGL symbols is not always

   under the Pivy Coin-in-Python binding's interpreter.)

   Another example is Windows platforms, where GetProcAddress() will
   *only* resolve symbols from the specific DLL module handle, so
   there it seems like we will have to use the OpenGL DLL handle
   directly.

   Therefore, various handles are tried in sequence: first the process
   handle (which usually works for UNIX- and UNIX-like systems), then
   the Coin handle (which usually works for the special cases, as when
   Coin is running within a dynamic language interpreter), then a
   handle directly to OpenGL (which should work for Windows
   platforms).

   Testing is done in that succession because chances are better at
   getting a valid handle for the process, than for Coin, which again
   is more likely to be available than one for OpenGL.
