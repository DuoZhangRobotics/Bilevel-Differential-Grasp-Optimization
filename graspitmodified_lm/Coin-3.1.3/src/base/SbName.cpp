  \class SbName SbName.h Inventor/SbName.h
  \brief The SbName class stores strings by reference.
  \ingroup base

  The class is used by Coin for storing keywords, names and other
  strings. They are stored in a manner where identical strings are
  guaranteed to map to the same memory address (as returned by the
  SbName::getString() method).

  The main advantage of storing identical strings to the same memory
  address is that it simplifies comparison operations, and
  particularly when working with string data as keys in other data
  structures, like e.g. in hash (dictionary) tables.

  Apart from that, mapping identical strings to the same memory
  address can also save on memory resources, and provide run-time
  optimizations. String comparisons for SbName objects are very
  efficient, for instance.


  There is an aspect of using SbName instances that it is important to
  be aware of: since strings are stored \e permanently, using SbName
  instances in code where there is continually changing strings or the
  continual addition of new unique strings will in the end swamp
  memory resources. So where possible, use SbString instances instead.
