  The MovieTexture node defines a time dependent texture map
  (contained in a movie file) and parameters for controlling the movie
  and the texture mapping. A MovieTexture node can also be used as the
  source of sound data for a Sound node. In this special case, the
  MovieTexture node is not used for rendering.  

  Texture maps are defined in a 2D coordinate system (s, t) that
  ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 in both directions. The bottom edge of the
  image corresponds to the S-axis of the texture map, and left edge of
  the image corresponds to the T-axis of the texture map. The
  lower-left pixel of the image corresponds to s=0.0, t=0.0, and the
  top-right pixel of the image corresponds to s=1.0, t=1.0. Figure
  6.12 depicts the texture map coordinate system of the MovieTexture.

  The url field that defines the movie data shall support
  MPEG1-Systems (audio and video) or MPEG1-Video (video-only) movie
  file formats 2 Details on the url field can be found in 4.5, VRML
  and the World Wide Web
  (<http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-VRML97/part1/concepts.html#4.5>).
  MovieTexture nodes can be referenced by an Appearance node's texture
  field (as a movie texture) and by a Sound node's source field (as an
  audio source only).  See 4.6.11, Texture maps
  (<http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-VRML97/part1/concepts.html#4.6.11>),
  for a general description of texture maps.  4.14, Lighting model
  (<http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-VRML97/part1/concepts.html#4.14>),
  contains details on lighting equations and the interaction between
  textures, materials, and geometries.  

  As soon as the movie is loaded, a duration_changed eventOut is
  sent. This indicates the duration of the movie in seconds. This
  eventOut value can be read (for instance, by a Script node) to
  determine the duration of a movie. A value of "-1" implies the movie
  has not yet loaded or the value is unavailable for some reason.  

  The loop, startTime, and stopTime exposedFields and the isActive
  eventOut, and their effects on the MovieTexture node, are discussed
  in detail in the 4.6.9, Time-dependent nodes, section
  (<http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-VRML97/part1/concepts.html#4.6.9>).

  The cycle of a MovieTexture node is the length of time in seconds
  for one playing of the movie at the specified speed.  The speed
  exposedField indicates how fast the movie shall be played.  A speed
  of 2 indicates the movie plays twice as fast. The duration_changed
  output is not affected by the speed exposedField. set_speed events
  are ignored while the movie is playing. A negative speed implies
  that the movie will play backwards.  

  If a MovieTexture node is inactive when the movie is first loaded,
  frame 0 of the movie texture is displayed if speed is non-negative
  or the last frame of the movie texture is shown if speed is negative
  (see 4.11.3, Discrete and continuous changes).  A MovieTexture node
  shall display frame 0 if speed = 0. For positive values of speed, an
  active MovieTexture node displays the frame at movie time t as
  follows (i.e., in the movie's local time system with frame 0 at time
  0 with speed = 1): 
  
  \verbatim
    t = (now - startTime) modulo (duration/speed)
  \endverbatim

  If speed is negative, the MovieTexture node displays the frame at movie
  time:
  
  \verbatim
    t = duration - ((now - startTime) modulo |duration/speed|)
  \endverbatim

  When a MovieTexture node becomes inactive, the frame corresponding
  to the time at which the MovieTexture became inactive will remain as
  the texture.
