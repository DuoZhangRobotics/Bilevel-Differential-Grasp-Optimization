This example is set up for Coin.  It won't work for the other
Open Inventor implementations without serious Makefile changes.

If the build fails, open the Makefile to see if there are any
suggestions wrt build problems in there...

UNIX:

  Build the shared objects (with GNU make)

    $ make

  Make sure the shared objects are in the dynamic load path

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

  Load "scene.iv" into an examinerviewer

    $ ../SoGuiExamples/components/examinerviewer scene.iv

  Switch viewer to interaction mode, and press keys on the keyboard
  to see them react in the 3D model.

CYGWIN:

  Build the shared objects (with GNU make)

    $ make

  Make sure the shared objects are in the dynamic load path

    [don't think this step is necessary for "." though]
    $ export PATH=".:$PATH"

  Load "scene.iv" into an examinerviewer

    $ ../SoGuiExamples/components/examinerviewer scene.iv

  Switch viewer to interaction mode, and press keys on the keyboard
  to see them react in the 3D model.
