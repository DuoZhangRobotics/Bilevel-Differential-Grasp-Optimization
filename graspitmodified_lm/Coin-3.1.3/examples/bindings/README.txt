These are examples for people who don't want to use Quarter, SoQt,
SoWin, Sc21, or any other of the libraries we provide for binding Coin
into your particular widget / GUI library.

If you are already up and running with e.g. Quarter, SoQt or SoWin,
these are unlikely to be of particular interest to you as an
application programmer.

The examples provides a few quick pointers on how to implement one's
own custom binding, with a simple rendering canvas and the minimum
necessary event queue handling, and are not supposed to be more
extensive than that.
