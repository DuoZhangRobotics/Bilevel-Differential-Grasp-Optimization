This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Kongsberg Oil & Gas
Technologies. Double-click on Coin.pkg to start the installation. If
you intend to develop without using Xcode, you should also install the
CoinTools package, which contains the coin-config commandline utility,
its associated man page, and its default configuration.

If you do not want to use an installer, you can find a package
containing only the framework itself on our ftp server[0] (look
for Coin-@VERSION@-gcc4-no_inst.dmg).

Note that this binary SDK has been built with gcc 3.3, meaning
that no earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with
this framework. The framework is, however, built with
MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.2 to be deployable on 10.2 (Jaguar) or
later versions of Mac OS X.

The Coin3D/Mac homepage[2] contains more information on how to get
started using Coin. You might also want to consider joining our
public mailing list for discussions related to Coin3D development[3].

Enjoy!
