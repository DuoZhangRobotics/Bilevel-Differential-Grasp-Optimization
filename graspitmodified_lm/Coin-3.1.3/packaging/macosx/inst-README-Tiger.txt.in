This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Kongsberg Oil & Gas
Technologies. Double-click on Coin.pkg to start installation. If you
do not want to use an installer, you can find a package containing
only the framework itself (called Coin-@VERSION@-no_inst.dmg) at
ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

If you intend to develop without using Xcode, you should also install
the CoinTools package, which contains the coin-config commandline
utility, its associated man page, and its default configuration. The
coin tools are a convenience if you want to build Coin applications
from the Terminal, and are also needed when compiling SoQt.

Note that this binary SDK has been built with gcc 4.0, meaning that
no earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with this
framework. Due to the ABI changes in gcc 4.0, the framework can
only be used on Mac OS 10.4 "Tiger". For more information, please
read the relevant FAQ entry at http://www.coin3d.org/mac/faq/#tiger

Check out http://www.coin3d.org/mac for information on how to get
started using Coin.

Enjoy!
