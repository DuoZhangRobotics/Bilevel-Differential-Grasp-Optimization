The debianized source archive for Coin is built from the standard
source distribution of Coin by running "make debian-packages" in
the base directory.  The only changes done to the standard source
distribution is the setting up of the debian/ directory.  The files
in the debian directory are created from templates found in the
packaging/debian directory.

Likewise, the debianized source archive can produce the standard
non-debianized source distribution archive by running "make dist"
in the base directory.

The Coin3D project is hosted at http://www.coin3d.org/.
