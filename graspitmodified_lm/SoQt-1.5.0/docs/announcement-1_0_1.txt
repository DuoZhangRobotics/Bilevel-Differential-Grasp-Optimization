We do not yet provide pre-compiled binary packages of the SoQt library
for any platform. The reason behind this is that the Qt library on
which SoQt depends can be installed on client systems in so many
different configurations and under different names, that this task
seems difficult to do in a way that will be useful for the majority of
our users.

There are efforts under way to make SoQt a standard part of the Debian
GNU/Linux system (just as libCoin already is).
