This is just a short announcement that we have released SoQt v1.0.2.
It contains a few bugfixes over 1.0.1, but is mostly a maintenance
release we've done because we now have in place the infrastructure
to provide MS Developer Studio files with the win32 installer.

Download URLs are provided below.  The source is available now, the
win32 installer is building now and will be available in a little
while.

ftp://ftp.coin3d.org/pub/coin/src/SoQt-1.0.2.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.coin3d.org/pub/coin/bin/win32/soqt-v1.0.2-install.exe

Cheers,

  Lars J
