SoQt 1.2.0 Released
===================

SoQt 1.2.0 is a minor release.  It was made because it was about time to
get SoQt into a release cycle again.  The release contains bugfixes,
optimizations, documentation improvements, and configure and build setup
fixes.  It also contains some minor API extensions beyond the previous
release.

We do not provide pre-compiled binary packages of the SoQt library
for any platform. The reason behind this is that the Qt library on
which SoQt depends can be installed on client systems in so many
different configurations and under different names, that this task
seems difficult to do in a way that will be useful for the majority of
our users.
