We do not provide pre-compiled binary packages of the SoQt library
for any platform. The reason behind this is that the Qt library on
which SoQt depends can be installed on client systems in so many
different configurations and different names, that this task seems
difficult to do in a way that will be useful for the majority of
our users.
