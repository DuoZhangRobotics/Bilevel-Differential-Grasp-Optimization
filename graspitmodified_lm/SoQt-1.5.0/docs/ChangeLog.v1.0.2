	Add environment variable FORCE_NO_QTMAC_31_RESIZE_WORKAROUND, which
	makes it possible to disable the workaround for the GL context
	resize problem in Qt/Mac 3.1.x. (This problem will be fixed in
	Qt/Mac 3.1.2, and is already fixed in current Qt/Mac snapshots.
	People using a current snapshot should be able to turn off the
	workaround.)

2003-01-23 16:46  kyrah

	* src/Inventor/Qt/: SoQtGLWidget.cpp, SoQtGLWidgetP.h:
	
	Fix for a problem with Qt/Mac 3.1 -- textures used to disappear
	when the viewer window was resized. The problem was due to a hack
	in Qt/Mac -- they sometimes destroy and re-create the OpenGL
	context. (*No comment*) In these cases, we have to register a new
	context as well to get a new cache context ID.

2003-01-22 12:01  kyrah

	* src/Inventor/Qt/viewers/: ExaminerViewer.cpp, FullViewer.cpp,
	PlaneViewer.cpp:
	
	Draw the buttons in the viewer decoration in the Windows style on
	Qt/Mac.
	
	(Since Qt/Mac 3.1.x, all pushbuttons (even those < 32x32) are drawn
	using the Aqua style, i.e. with rounded edges and shading. This
	looks really ugly in the viewer decoration. Drawing the buttons in
	the Windows style gives us the flat, square buttons we want.)

2003-01-20 13:15  kyrah

	* README.MAC:
	
	Removed outdated (and possibly confusing) information

2003-01-20 12:58  kyrah

	* src/Inventor/Qt/SoQtComponent.cpp:
	
	Undo my last changes, since that fixed only half of the problem.
	The custom cursor problem with Qt 3.1.1 is an acknowledged Qt bug,
	and will be fixed in the next version.	Until then, just use the
	standard arrow cursor instead of our custom cursor, and spit out a
	warning.

2003-01-17 15:43  kyrah

	* src/Inventor/Qt/SoQtComponent.cpp:
	
	Custom cursors > 16x16 do not work correctly in Qt/Mac versions
	3.1.0 and 3.1.1 - the displayed graphics look totally wrong. We
	normally use 32x32 bitmaps for all cursors, since this is the
	recommended cursor size that works on all platforms, but as a
	workaround, let's use the real size (usually 16x16 px) on these
	versions....

2003-01-16 19:11  kyrah

	* src/Inventor/Qt/viewers/FullViewer.cpp:
	
	Workaround for a bug in Qt/Mac 3.1.0 and 3.1.1: If the OpenGL
	context overlaps with the QSizeGrip widget (generated by default),
	resizing does not work any more. The workaround is to leave 15
	pixels at the lower border of the window blank...

2002-12-16 17:26  kyrah

	* src/Inventor/Qt/devices/: SoQtKeyboard.cpp, SoQtMouse.cpp:
	
	Qt::ControlButton now refers to the Apple key, no longer the Ctrl
	key. We still want to emulate the right mouse button by ctrl-click,
	though -> another ugly #if QT_VERSION ...

2002-10-28 14:37  mortene

2002-10-22 16:28  rolvs

	* src/Inventor/Qt/viewers/FullViewer.cpp:
	
	A quick fix to BUG#014 (Viewers didn't resize if they was built
	without decorations), and at the same time it fixes a bug reported
	from Tamer Fahmy that setDecorations( TRUE ) bails out on an assert
	failure if the Viewer was built without decorations.
	
	Basically the fix makes sure that all widgets are built, and then
	hides the decorations if they are un-needed.

2002-10-14 16:15  mortene

	* src/Inventor/Qt/: SoQt.cpp, SoQtP.h:
	
	Reverse previous patch: there are good reasons for listing Win32
	DLL modules from SoQt, even though we also do it from Coin. (The
	SoQt lib could be built on top of SGI / TGS Inventor, for
	instance.)
