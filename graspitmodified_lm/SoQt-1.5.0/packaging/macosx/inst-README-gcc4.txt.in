This is SoQt-@VERSION@ by Kongsberg Oil & Gas
Technologies. Double-click on SoQt.pkg to start the installation. If
you intend to develop without using Xcode, you should also install the
SoQtTools package, which contains the soqt-config commandline utility,
its associated man page, and its default configuration.

If you do not want to use an installer, you can find a package
containing only the framework itself on our ftp server[0] (look
for SoQt-@VERSION@-gcc4-no_inst.dmg).

SoQt is a GUI binding for Coin. For it to be useful, you will need to
install Coin (or another Open Inventor implementation). You can
download the Coin binary SDK from the ftp server.

Note that this binary SDK has been built with gcc 4.0, meaning that
no earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with this
framework. Due to the ABI changes in gcc 4.0, applications built
against this framework can only be used on Mac OS 10.4 "Tiger" or
Mac OS 10.3.9.

The Coin3D/Mac homepage[1] contains more information on how to get
started using Coin and SoQt. You might also want to consider
joining our public mailing list for discussions related to Coin3D
development[2].

Enjoy!
